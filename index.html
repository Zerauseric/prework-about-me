      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi, my name is Eric Suarez. I'm a twenty two year old, full-time meat clerk at Stater Bros as well as a part time student at UCR Extension for full stack computer programming.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from San Bernardino in Southern California</p>
      <h1>What are my favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy playing piano, reading fiction(Currently "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"), playing videogames(Feverently awaiting CyberPunk 2077), and I'm currently learning how to sail! </p>
      <h1>What's my dream job?</h1>
      <p>A dream job for me would be in any company that pays me to be creative. I've worked for about 8 years in jobs where my duties consisted of following a list of orders for 8 hours, then go home to rest in anticipation for the next 8.</p>
      <h1>Where do I live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Bloomington California but would love to move any place in the world really. As long as my career involves programming, experiencing a new city would just be a big plus.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I strongly belive that a good website/online presence is the great equalizer of small buisness. Its what separates new buisnesses from established ones. My goal as an aspiring web developer is to give assistance to those who have decided to take the risk and become entrepreneurs. </p>
